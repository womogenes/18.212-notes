## Catalan Numbers
$C_n$, defined for $n \ge 0$

Many ways to define them!

**Definition**. $C_n$ is the # of sequences of $\{-1, 1\}$ of length $2n$ such that:
- any partial sum is $\ge 0$ for all $i$
- the sum of all the numbers is 0.

**Dyck paths.** Graph of the partial sums of the sequences over index.

**First few numbers:**
- $C_0 = 1$
- $C_1 = 1$
- $C_2 = 2$
- $C_3 = 5$
- $C_4 = 12$
- $C_5 = 42$

**Theorem 1.**
$$ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}. $$
**Theorem 2.** $C_n$ is the number of **triangulations** of a convex $(n+2)$-gon.
- A triangulation is a way of dividing a polygon into triangles using non-crossing diagonals.

**Theorem 3.** $C_n$ is the number of **parenthesizations** of $(n+1)$ letters (or $n$ parentheses)

**Theorem 4.** $C_n$ is the number of rooted **plane binary trees** with $n$ vertices
- The root is defined, and the left and right children are distinct.

**Theorem 4.5.** $C_n$ = number of rooted **complete plane binary trees** with $(n+1)$ leaves.
- Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

**Theorem 5.** $C_n$ = the number of rooted **plane trees** with $(n+1)$ vertices.
- If a node has only one child, we don't need to specify whether it's left or right.

**Theorem 6.** $C_n$ = the number of non-crossing perfect matchings on $2n$ vertices.
- Vertices are labeled.
- This is somewhat reminiscent of parenthesization
## Bijections
- Between triangulations of an $(n+2)$-gon and plane binary trees with $n$ vertices
	- There are $n$ triangles
	- Mark one triangle as special (maybe the one adjacent to the top/bottom edge), and adjacent triangles are connected via an edge in the tree
- Complete plane binary trees with $(n+1)$ leaves and parenthesization of $(n+1)$ letters
	- Leaves are letters and non-leaf nodes are groupings of the letters in the left subtree with letters in the right subtree
- Plane trees with $(n+1)$ vertices and Dyck paths with $2n$ steps
	- DFS -- when going down, do +1, and when going up, do -1.
