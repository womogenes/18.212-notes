Goal: create a bijection between length-$n$ permutations of $(1, \dots, n)$ and pairs $(P, Q)$ of Young Tableaux of the same shape.
## Insertion
"Schensted insertion"

Algorithm for inserting numbers into incomplete Young Tableaux
- Put the number in the first row (bump out the largest number possible)
- That number goes to the next row and tries to bump it out

RSK algorithm
- How to map $w = (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n)$ to $(P, Q)$?
- On step $i$, insert $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ into $P$ (in order)
	- The new _box_ (shape-wise) gets $i$ in $Q$

Corollary:
$$\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} (f_\lambda)^2 = n!!$$
Theorem:
- For $\omega \in S_n$, if $\omega \mapsto (P, Q)$, then $\omega^{-1} \mapsto (Q, P)$.

Corollary:
$$\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} f_\lambda = \{(P, P) \mid \text{ pairs SYT of shape }\lambda\}$$
## Green's theorem
**Def.** The shape $\lambda$ of $P$ and $Q$ is the **Schensted shape** of $w$.

**Def.** Given a permutation $w = (w_1, \dots, w_n)$, an increasing sequence is
$$w_{i_1} < w_{i_2} < \dots w_{i_k}$$
where $i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k$. A decreasing sequence is the opposite.

**Theorem.** Let $\lambda$ be the Schensted shape of $w$. Then
- The size of the 1st row is the maximum length of the increasing sequence in $w$, and
- The size of the first column is the maximum length of the **decreasing** sequence in $w$.
