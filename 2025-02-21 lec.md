Recall, the Eulerian triangle:
$$A(n,k) = (n-k) \cdot A(n-1,k-1) + (k+1) \cdot A(n-1,k)$$
With base case:
$$A(1,0) = 1$$
Also, the function defined by
$$f_n(x) = (x \cdot f_{n-1}(x))'$$satisfies
$$f_n(x) = \frac{\sum A(n,k) \cdot x^k}{(1-x)^{n+1}}.$$
## $\tilde{A}$
Now, define a new thing:
$$\tilde{A}(n,k) = \#\{w \in S_n \mid \text{des}(w) = k\}$$
Which counts the number of length$-$n permutations that have $k$ descents. Recall: a descent is an index $i$ where
$$w_i > w_{i+1}.$$

**Theorem.** $\tilde{A}(n,k) = A(n,k)$.

**Proof.** Permutations $w \in S_k$ are obtained from permutations $u \in S_{n-1}$ by inserting the new entry $n$ somewhere in the sequence. Casework:
- Insert $n$ into an existing ascent. This increases the number of descents.
	- e.g. 1, 2 -> 1, n, 2
- Insert $n$ into an existing **de**scent. This changes nothing.
	- e.g. 2, 1 -> 2, n, 1

For the purposes of convention, pretend there's a $-\infty$ at the very beginning and a $-\infty$ at the very end, so the first slot (pre-entire-sequence) is an ascent and the last slot is a descent.

Assume $\text{des}(w) = k$.

Casework:
1. $\text{des}(u) = k-1$, and $u$ has $n-k$ ascent slots.
2. $\text{des}(u) = k$, and $u$ has $(k+1)$ descent slots.

## Stirling Numbers
There are two kinds of Stirling Numbers: those of the first kind and those of the second kind.

First kind:
- Signless. $c(n, k)$ is the number of permutations in $S_n$ with exactly $k$ cycles (including fixed points).
	- This is also the number of permutations in $S_n$ with $k$ "records" (we defined this last time with the rearranging-cycles-so-the-largest-numbers-are-in-front-etc)
- Signed. $s(n,k)$ is $c(n,k) \cdot (-1)^{n-k}.$
Second kind:
- $S(n,k)$ is the number of set partitions of $[n]$ with $k$ blocks (what is a set partition ??)
- A set partition $\pi = (B_1 \mid B_2 \mid \dots \mid B_k)$ is a partition of $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ into **disjoint, nonempty subsets**.
- We also don't care about the order of blocks.
- Example: $S(4, 2) = 7$ because there are 4 partitions into 3/1 blocks and 3 partitions into 2/2 blocks.

\[working through 1st stirling triangle\]

First kind numbers satisfy:
$$c(n,k) = c(n-1, k-1) + (n-1) \cdot c(n-1, k).$$

Second kind numbers satisfy:
$$S(n,k) = S(n-1, k-1) + k \cdot S(n-1, k).$$
**Proof.** To make a new partition, we insert $n$ into a length-$(n-1)$ permutation. Then either:
- $n$ is a fixed point, which gives $S(n-1, k-1)$.
- $n$ is NOT a fixed point, which means we stick it in any of the existing $k$ cycles. There are $S(n-1, k)$ ways that this could exist.

## Explicit form
Define:
$$(x)_n = x(x-1)(x-2) \cdots (x-n+1).$$
This is known as a **falling factorial**.

Two linear bases of $\mathbb{R}[x]$:
1. $1, x, x^2, x^3, \dots$
2. $1, x, x(x-1), x(x-1)(x-2), \dots$

Turns out Stirling numbers give you a way to translate between these two bases.
