Last time:
- We defined a vector space ("linear space") where the vectors are elements in the Young lattice
- Operators: $U(\lambda)$ goes up a row (adding a box), $D(\lambda)$ goes down a row
- Crucial lemma:
	- $DU - UD = I$
	- $D(\emptyset) = 0$

Assume we have a sequence of Ds and a sequence of Us, with equal numbers of each.=-0In general, we can split things up into the flipped part and $I$
- $DDDUUU = DDUDUU + DDIUU$
- because $DU = UD + I$

Eventually, we are left with terms that are all
- $U^i D^i$ for some $i \ge 1$, or
- $I$

**Claim.** each $I$ term in the sum is determined uniquely by pairing each $D$ with a $U$ that comes after it
- Every time we have a $D$ and a $U$ that are not paired, we should swap them, which produces an $I$ term
- Every pairing produces an $I$ (otherwise if it is not a valid pairing we get stuck with a $U^i D^i$)

For $D^n U^n (\emptyset)$, we start with $DD\dots DUU\dots U$, and we need to pair every $D$ with a $U$
- There are $n!$ ways to do this

**Theorem.** Let $P$ be the set of strings with $n$ $U$s and $n$ $D$s. Then
$$\sum_{p\in P} P(\emptyset)$$
equals the number of perfect matchings on $2n$ elements. = $(2n-1)!!$

*Proof.* If $P$ is not a Dyck path (remember $P$ is written in reverse order because operator-style so the right letters act first), then $P(\emptyset)=0$ because we go more down than up.

Otherwise, given a perfect matching, label the 1st vertex of each pair with a $D$ and the 2nd vertex with a $P$.
- This contributes an $I(\emptyset)$ term.

## Bijection with rook placements
Place $X$s in the row & column of each matched pair $D, U$.

Notably, every $D$ is in a different column _by definition_. Every column, similarly.

## Meta woah
What's the bijection between rook placements and paths in $\mathbb{Y}$ from $\emptyset$ to $\emptyset$ with $2n$ steps?

Bijection: if we add the box in row $i+1$, corresponds to removing the box in row $i$


Exercise: This map is the same as RSK: $w \mapsto (P, q)$
